# Scope of Work

Already have a few node packages to convert AVRO to Typescript:
- https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=AVRO%20to%20Typescript

Also some to convert JSON Schemas to AVRO:
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-to-avro

This package assumes you have sample data but no pre-existing schema. It uses [@avro/types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@avro/types) to help convert JSON to an AVRO buffer.
