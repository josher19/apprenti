This will convert JSON files and JavaScript Objects to an inferred AVRO schema

Already have a few node packages to convert AVRO to Typescript:
- https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=AVRO%20to%20Typescript

Also some to convert JSON Schemas to AVRO:
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-to-avro

This package assumes you have sample data but no pre-existing schema. It uses (@avro/types)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@avro/types]
